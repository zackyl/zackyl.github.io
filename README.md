## Getting Started

This is a Jekyll + Github pages site.
To build and develop locally, you'll need to have Ruby and [Jeykll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) installed.

To build the site any time a source file changes and serve locally, run:
```sh
jekyll s
```

## Updating Roles

Simply make your changes to the `_data/jobs.yml` file and they'll be reflected in the final rendered site.
